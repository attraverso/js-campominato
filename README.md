### Assignment:
Simplified minesweeper.

**Minimum requirements:**
- Randomly generate 16 integers between 1 and 100, which represent the mines.
- Ask the user for a number between 1 and 100, which represents their move.
- If the user's number is amongst the 16 mines the game ends, otherwise the user needs to pick another number to continue playing.
- The game ends when the user chooses a 'forbidden' number (a mine) or when they reach the limit of possibile moves (they play the other 84 numbers without ever selecting a mine)

**Bonus round:**
At the beginning, ask the user to choose a difficulty level. The number of mines stays the same, but the total number of options decreases in higher levels.
- level 0 -> numbers up to 100
- level 1 -> numbers up to 80
- level 2 -> numbers up to 50

### Goals:

Practice the do/while loop and get hands-on experience with a slightly more complex assignment while still writing clean code.
